This document contains a few information about the modifications I made to the website and the Images reference.

A few changes from the original mockup created in the Design Foundations class were made:

	1. The navigation was centered to have a better look as the original mock-up was too close to the button of the nav.
	2. Uppercase fonts were decided to use and the words "About Us" and "Contact Us" were changed to "ABOUT" and "CONTACT" to give a better look to the navigation. 
	3. The purple square was removed as it would be difficult to create the overlay look using grids and it was chosen just one of the two fonts used in the H1.
	4. A footer was created because there was no footer in the original mockup.
	5. I decided to use a different style file for the contact page because I could organize the code better doing this way.
