# Web Portfolio 

## Notes

The most challenge part I faced creating this web portfolio was the Projects Section. 

### Improvements: 
There are some improvements I would like to make to my portfolio in the future: 
- First, I would like to create a navigation bar that changes the color when scrolling, so I can have a total transparent navbar on the first page and a solid colored navbar once the user reaches the About section and beyond. 
- Secondly, once I develop more projects, I would like to create one page for each category (UI/UX Design, Web Design, and Graphic Design), and gather all my projects related to that category on their specific page. 
- Thirdly, I would like to add a form section where the users can send me messages directily from the webpage.
